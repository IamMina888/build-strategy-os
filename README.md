🌱 Initial Commit – Build Strategy OS™: Chaos → Clarity

This is the foundational commit of Build Strategy OS™ — a system born out of real-world chaos. It was inspired by one unforgettable experience working with a client whose business was drowning in scattered workflows, disorganized marketing, and operational overwhelm.

Instead of just surviving the storm, we built a solution: a centralized, scalable operations and creative strategy OS designed to bring clarity, control, and growth where there was once only confusion.

💡 What’s included in this milestone:

⚙️ Core architecture built with Vite + React + TypeScript

🎨 Global styling system (globals.css, variables.css) and brand tokens

🧩 Core components: Hero, CTA, MarkdownRenderer, YouTubeBackground

📁 Project scaffolding: tsconfig, build scripts, Vite config

📦 Public assets, favicons, banners, and base media libraries

🚀 Why it matters:
This commit isn’t just code — it’s the foundation of a platform designed to help brands and business owners untangle chaos, systemize growth, and scale with precision. Build Strategy OS™ transforms overwhelm into opportunity — and this is where it all begins.
